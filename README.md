# Eye_Blink_Morse_code_detector
A hands-free communication system that detects eye blinks using MediaPipe and OpenCV to generate Morse code. Short and long blinks are translated into dots and dashes, decoded into text, and displayed in real time—enabling assistive communication through computer vision and Python.
